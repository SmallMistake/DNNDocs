> [!Warning]
> For your protection, remember to download or unzip files from reliable sources only.

Once you find the release you want, you will want to scroll down the releases information till you find a list of zip files at the bottom. For installation purposes, you will want to select the Install zip.

When it is done downloading, you have finished this step.

>  Do not unzip the file yet.

## Create a folder for your site

You will need to create a folder somewhere on your system to serve as the your DNN installation folder.

## Extract the install zip file into the new folder

After your folder is set up, right click and extract your install zip files contents into the new folder.

>[!Warning]
> Be sure to check if you need to unblock the zip file before you extract from it. You can find this button in the file properties. If its checkbox is unchecked, you will need to check the box and apply the changes
